# ðŸ§¾ On-Chain Notebook

A simple **Solidity-based on-chain notebook** that lets users jot down short daily thoughts directly onto the blockchain.  
Built for learners who want to explore how decentralized storage works using **smart contracts**.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Description

**On-Chain Notebook** is a blockchain-powered journaling app that stores your notes **immutably** on the Celo network.  
Each wallet address acts as its own notebook â€” where every note you write is safely recorded with a timestamp.  

Think of it as a **digital diary**, but instead of living on a central server, it lives **on-chain** â€” forever accessible and owned by you.

## ðŸš€ What It Does

- Allows users to **add short notes** tied to their wallet address.  
- Automatically saves a **timestamp** for each note.  
- Lets users **view**, **count**, and **list** all their saved notes.  
- Demonstrates **Solidity basics** such as mappings, structs, and arrays â€” perfect for beginners.
